                        This is my machinelearning powered SPY Predictor!  To train the model, I used SPY price action data dating back to 2009 and trained an LSTM time series neural network.  The model is only accurate 50 days into the future, and the last time that this model was updated was on July 30th 2023.  Please remember that this is purely an excercise in machine learning and do not take this as investment advice (see disclaimer).
